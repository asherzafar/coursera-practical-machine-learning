# Classifying Movements based on Accelerometer Data
This is the course project for the Practical Machine Learning Course. The objective of this assignment is to develop a model that can accurately predict out-of-sample whether a movement belonds to one of five classes. My approach includes tidying the data, setting up controls and hyperparameter searches, and cross-validating the results to estimate the out-of-sample accuracy, as well as holding out a test set. Data for this project came from the Human Activity Recognition project from Groupware@LES.
